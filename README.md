Office-hours-queue.  Currently making the baseline.

To run, make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/?jmp=footer) installed.  Use node 6 for now, because there is a conflict issue with node-sass and node 7.

First start MongoDB by running `mongod` in the terminal.

From the root directory of this project run `npm install` in the terminal.

Then, also from the root directory of this project run `npm run server` in the terminal.

Finally, run `npm start` in the terminal from the root directory of this project.
